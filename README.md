![Robocorp CLI (RCC)](/docs/title.png)

Robocorp command center or `rcc` is a set of tooling that allows you to create, mange, and distribute Python-based self-contained automation packages - or robots as we call them. Together with [robot.yaml](https://robocorp.com/docs/setup/robot-yaml-format) configuration file, `rcc` is a foundation that allows anyone to build and share automation with ease.

## Getting Started

* If you just want to use the `rcc` visit [Robocorp rcc documentation site](https://robocorp.com/docs/product-manuals/robocorp-cli) to get started.
* To build `rcc` from this repository see the [Setup Guide](/docs/BUILD.md)
