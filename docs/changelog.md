- fix: windows paths were wrong; "bin" to "usr" change

## v9.3.12 (date: 17.2.2021)

- introduced 48 hour delay to recycling temp folders (since clients depend on
  having temp around after rcc process is gone); this closes #12

## v9.3.11 (date: 15.2.2021)

- micromamba upgrade to 0.7.14
- made process fail early and visibly, if micromamba download fails

## v9.3.10 (date: 11.2.2021)

- Windows automation made environments dirty by generating comtypes/gen
  folder. Fix is to ignore that folder.
- Added some more diagnostics information.

## v9.3.9 (date: 8.2.2021)

- micromamba cleanup bug fix (got error if micromamba is missing)

## v9.3.7 (date: 4.2.2021)

- micromamba version printout changed, so rcc now parses new format
- micromamba is 0.x, so it does not follow semantic versioning yet, so
  rcc will now "lockstep" versions, with micromamba locked to 0.7.12 now

## v9.3.6 (date: 3.2.2021)

- removing "defaults" channel from robot templates

## v9.3.5 (date: 2.2.2021)

- micromamba upgrade to 0.7.12
- REGRESSION: `rcc task shell` got broken when micromamba was introduced,
  and this version fixes that

## v9.3.4 (date: 1.2.2021)

- fix: removing environments now uses rename first and then delete,
  to get around windows locked files issue
- warning: on windows, if environment is somehow locked by some process,
  this will fail earlier in the process (which is good thing), so be aware
- minor change on cache statistics representation and calculation

## v9.3.3 (date: 1.2.2021)

- adding `--dryrun` option to issue reporting

## v9.3.2 (date: 29.1.2021)

- added environment variables for installation identity, opt-out status as
  `RCC_INSTALLATION_ID` and `RCC_TRACKING_ALLOWED`

## v9.3.1 (date: 29.1.2021)

- fix: when environment is leased, temporary folder is will not be recycled
- cleanup command now cleans also temporary folders based on day limit

## v9.3.0 (date: 28.1.2021)

- support for applications to submit issue reports thru rcc

  of issue reporting
- added links to diagnostic checks, for user guidance

## v9.2.0 (date: 25.1.2021)

- experiment: carrier PoC

## v9.1.0 (date: 25.1.2021)

- new command `rcc configure diagnostics` to help identify environment
  related issues
- also requiring new version of micromamba, 0.7.10

## v9.0.2 (date: 21.1.2021)

## v9.0.1 (date: 20.1.2021)

- BREAKING CHANGES
- removal of legacy "package.yaml" support

## v9.0.0 (date: 18.1.2021)

- BREAKING CHANGES
- new cli option `--lease` to request longer lasting environment (1 hour from
  lease request, and next requests refresh the lease)
- new environment variable: `RCC_ENVIRONMENT_HASH` for clients to use
- new command `rcc env unlease` to stop leasing environments
- this breaks contract of pristine environments in cases where one application
  has already requested long living lease, and other wants to use environment
  with exactly same specification (if pristine, it is shared, otherwise it is
  an error)

- repodata TTL is reduced to 16 hours, and in case of environment creation
  failure, fall back to 0 seconds TTL (immediate update)

## v8.0.5 (date: 8.1.2021)

- added robot test to validate required changes, which are common/version.go
  and docs/changelog.md

## v8.0.4 (date: 8.1.2021)

- now requires micromamba 0.7.7 at least, with version check added
- micromamba now brings --repodata-ttl, which rcc currently sets for 7 days
- and touching conda caches is gone because of repodata ttl
- can now also cleanup micromamba binary and with --all
- environment validation checks simplified (no more separate space check)

## v8.0.3 (date: 7.1.2021)

- adding path validation warnings, since they became problem (with pip) now
  that we moved to use micromamba instead of miniconda
- also validation pattern update, with added "~" and "-" as valid characters
- validation is now done on toplevel, so all commands could generate
  those warnings (but currently they don't break anything yet)

## v8.0.2 (date: 5.1.2021)

- fixing failed robot tests for progress indicators (just tests)

## v8.0.1 (date: 5.1.2021)

- added separate pip install phase progress step (just visualization)

## v8.0.0 (date: 5.1.2021)

- BREAKING CHANGES
- removed miniconda3 download and installing
- removed all conda commands (check, download, and install)
- environment variables `CONDA_EXE` and `CONDA_PYTHON_EXE` are not available
  anymore (since we don't have conda installation anymore)
- adding micromamba download, installation, and usage functionality
- dropping 32-bit support from windows and linux, this is breaking change,
  so that is why version series goes up to v8

## v7.1.5 (date: 4.1.2021)

- now command `rcc man changelog` shows changelog.md from build moment

## v7.1.4 (date: 4.1.2021)
